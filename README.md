# Cable-Management-Devices

Designs for 3D printable devices to aid in cable management to improve FRC robot reliability.

There are three designs in this repo.  Each design has the SolidWorks file, a STEP file, and
an STL file for printing.

## Printing Recommendations

The Anchors should be printed on their side so the filament orientation supports the "ears".

## Cable Anchor

The cable anchor is riveted to a robot feature (e.g. belly pan). Cables are passed through
the gap of the anchor and a zip tie (or twist tie) is inserted through the "ears"
to hold the cable down and link the wire to the robot feature.

## Cable Anchor (Small)

This is a smaller version of the Cable Anchor.

## Ethernet Cable Brace

The brace is screwed to a robot feature (e.g. belly pan) adjacent to a RoboRIO. The brace
has the option to press in a heat set insert on the bottom.  If a heat set insert is not
used, a longer bolt may go through the entire length.

An ethernet cable is intended to be captured (held) in the vertical groove and held in place
by two zip ties using the provided grooves.
